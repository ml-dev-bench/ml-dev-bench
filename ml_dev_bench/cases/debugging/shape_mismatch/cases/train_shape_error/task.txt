You need to debug and fix an error in model training.

Your task:
1. Run the training script using run_training.py to see the error
2. Fix the issues by modifying train.py
3. Test your fix by running run_training.py again

Rules:
- Only modify train.py
- Do not change the model architecture or the dataset
- The training should run without any errors
