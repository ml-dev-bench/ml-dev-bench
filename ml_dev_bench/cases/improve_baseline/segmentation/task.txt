Your task is to improve the performance of a semantic segmentation model using torchvision models.

Requirements:
1. Use any appropriate pretrained model from torchvision.models.segmentation
2. Achieve at least 20% relative improvement in mean IoU (mIoU) through:
   - Appropriate model selection and initialization
   - Effective training strategies
   - Data augmentation techniques
   - Learning rate scheduling
   - Any other optimization techniques
3. Maintain proper handling of all semantic classes
4. Ensure proper normalization and preprocessing of the dataset

Required Output:
Create an output_info.json file with the following information:
{
    "model_name": "torchvision.models.segmentation.xxx",  // The specific model used
    "initial_miou": float,  // Initial mean IoU before training
    "final_miou": float,    // Final mean IoU after training
    "class_ious": [float],  // List of IoU values for each class
    "training_time": float, // Total training time in seconds
    "num_classes": int      // Number of semantic classes
}

The goal is to demonstrate significant improvement in segmentation performance through effective training strategies and optimizations.

Proceed with implementation until the task is complete. Do not request additional input or clarification.
