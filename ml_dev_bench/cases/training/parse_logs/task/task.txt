Analyze the training logs to extract key information appropriately:

1. In the 'training' directory, there is a file called 'training_logs.txt'
2. Read and analyze the training logs to determine:
   - Training status (success/failure)
   - Final training metrics (accuracy, loss) from the last successful epoch
   - Any error messages if training failed
3. Save your findings in a JSON file named 'training_analysis.json' inside the 'training' directory with the following structure:
   {
     "status": "failed" or "success",
     "final_metrics": {
       "accuracy": float or null,
       "loss": float or null
     },
     "error_message": string (empty if successful)
   }
