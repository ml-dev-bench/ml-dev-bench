Create and run a machine learning training workflow from scratch until completion.

Requirements:

1. Dataset Setup:
- Download the noisy_imagenette dataset 160px version from the official source https://s3.amazonaws.com/fast-ai-imageclas/imagenette2-160.tgz
- The dataset comes with a CSV file with 1%, 5%, 25%, and 50% noisy labels
- Extract and save the 50% noisy labels from the above csv in noisy_labels_50.csv, with two columns (path, label) one for the image path and its corresponding noisy label;
- Use the 50% noisy labels from the saved noisy_labels_50.csv and the provided train and validation splits

2. Training Setup:
- Use a pretrained ViT-S/14 dinov2 model for training, see https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2 for instructions loading and using

3. Training Execution:
- Train the model for four epochs
- Save the checkpoints in the checkpoints directory
- Generate and save training and validation metrics to training_metrics.json
- Capture the best validation accuracy (in percentage) and add it as 'best_val_acc' key to the metrics json

Expected Directory Structure:
├── dataset/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/
|   └── noisy_labels_50.csv
├── checkpoints/
│   └── *.pt (checkpoint files)
└── training_metrics.json

Note: Proceed with implementation and execution until training is complete, do not request for additional user input or give instructions to users.
