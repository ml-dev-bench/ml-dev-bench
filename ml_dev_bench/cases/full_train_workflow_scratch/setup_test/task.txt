Create and run a machine learning training workflow from scratch until completion.

Requirements:

1. Dataset Setup:
- Download the noisy_imagenette dataset 160px version from the official source https://github.com/fastai/imagenette
- Use the 5% noisy labels version of the dataset and the provided train and validation splits

2. Training Setup:
- Use a pretrained ViT-S/14 dinov2 model for training, see https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2 for instructions loading and using

3. Training Execution:
- Train the model for four epochs
- Save the checkpoints in the checkpoints directory
- Generate and save training and validation metrics to training_metrics.json
- Capture the best validation accuracy (in percentage) and add it as 'best_val_acc' key to the metrics json

Expected Directory Structure:
workspace/
├── dataset/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/
├── checkpoints/
│   └── *.pt (checkpoint files)
└── training_metrics.json

Note: Proceed with implementation and execution until task is complete, do not request for additional user input or give instructions to users.
