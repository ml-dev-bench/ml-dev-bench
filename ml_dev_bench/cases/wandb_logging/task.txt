You are working on a simple PyTorch training verification task. Create a minimal working example that:

1. Initialize W&B with:
   - Project name: "ml_workflow_test_wandb"
   - Run name: "test-run-{timestamp}"
   - Tags: ["test", "evaluation"]
   Save the initialization results (including run_id) to wandb_info.json

2. Read the run_id from wandb_info.json and use it to log these metrics:
   - training_loss: 0.5
   - validation_loss: 0.4
   - epoch: 0

3. Read the run_id from wandb_info.json again and use it to retrieve the metrics via API.
   Compare the retrieved metrics with the expected values to verify:
   - training_loss == 0.5
   - validation_loss == 0.4
   - epoch == 0
   Dump the retrieved metrics to wandb_metrics.json

Success criteria:
- wandb_info.json is created with run initialization info
- All specified metrics are logged using run_id from the json file
- Metrics are correctly retrieved and verified using run_id from the json file

Note: This approach ensures proper tracking of the run_id through a file, making the workflow more robust and verifiable.
